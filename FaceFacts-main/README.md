This is the source code to accompany a YouTube livestream from December 22nd 2023 – it’s a small but complete app for iOS, aimed at helping folks take their first steps with SwiftUI and SwiftData. This project was built using Xcode 15.1, but should work fine in any newer Xcode version.

You can watch the stream’s replay here: https://youtube.com/live/n4SCMC25BxY
